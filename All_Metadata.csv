,Electrical Distribution Grid Maps,"Facebook has produced a model to help map global medium voltage (MV) grid infrastructure, i.e. the distribution lines which connect high-voltage transmission infrastructure to consumer-serving low-voltage distribution. The data found here are model outputs for six select African countries: Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda, DRC, Cote D’Ivoire, and Zambia. The grid maps are produced using a new methodology that employs various publicly-available datasets (night time satellite imagery, roads, political boundaries, etc) to predict the location of existing MV grid infrastructure. The model documentation and code are also available , so data scientists and planners globally can replicate the model to expand model coverage to other countries where this data is not already available. You can find the model code and documentation here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/many-to-many-dijkstra
Note: current model accuracy is approximately 70% when compared to existing ground-truthed data. Accuracy can be further improved by integrating other locally-relevant information into the model and running it again.

,Priority Index Sri Lanka Floods May 2017,"This priority index was derived by combining a detailed flood extent mapping with detailed human settlement geo-data. Both sources were combined to produce the location and magnitude of population living in flooded areas. This was subsequently aggregated to admin-4 areas (GND) as well as admin-3 areas (DS divisional).
The flood extent mapping was derived in turn by combining two sources: Flood extent maps could be produced rather faster using satellite imageries captured by either optical sensors or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In most places flood is cause by heavy rainfall which means in most cases cloud is present, this is a limitation for optical sensors as they can’t penetrate clouds. Radar sensors are not affected by cloud, which make them more useful in presence of cloud. In This analysis we analyzed sentinel2 optical image from May 28th and Sentinel 1 SAR image from May 30th.  Then we combine the two results adding up the flood extents.
Main cloud covered areas and permanent water bodies are removed from the flood extent map using the Sentinel 2 cloud mask. The scale/resolution of the flood extent map is 30mts where as the permanent water body map has 250m scale resolution. This will introduce some discrepancy: part of flood extent  map could be permanent water body.
Analysis focused on 4 districts in South-West Sri Lanka based on news reports (https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0qdqe7qfgq6fyv/special_situation.pdf?dl=0). Based on the admin-3-level analysis, highest percentages of population living in flooded areas were seen in Matara district. Admin-4 level analysis concentrated only on Matara district for that reason.
The dataset is showing percentage flooded. The data has not yet been corrected for small populations. We believe the product is currently pointing to the high priority areas. In the shp or csv files the user of this data could easily correct for small populations, if there is a wish to target on the amount of people affected.
